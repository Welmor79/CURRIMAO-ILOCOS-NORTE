            <h2>Tabacalera</h2>
            <p>This tabacalera is claimed to be the biggest in the Ilocos region, and the best example of this genre in Philippine architecture. Its rectangular floor plan is not any different from the size of a normal church building(Ilocos Norte â€“ a travel guide book; II Ed: 2005). This is bigger than the tabacalera in Laoag City which houses the Museo Iloko. If this was located in the city, it could have been given the proper restoration and maintenance for future generations to know more of their history and culture.</p>
