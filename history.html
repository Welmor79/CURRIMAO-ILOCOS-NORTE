            <h2>Brief History of Currimao</h2>
            <p>During the Spanish regime, when Galleon Trade was still flourishing, Moro pirates frequented the coast of the China Sea. To protect the natives, the Spanish authorities built watchtowers at two strategic points, one at the tip of what is now called Arboledan Point and the other at Barangay Torre. Whenever pirates appeared on the horizon to attack the villages, the people manning the watchtowers warned the people by shouting "CORRER" which means "to run". As soon as the natives heard the shouts, they would hide to save themselves. During those times, the pirates were known among the natives as "CUMAWS", a name which struck the fear and terror among the people. It was from these two words that name CURRIMAO was derived.</p>
